I am advised by Haiyan Huang and Sam Pimentel, and I also work with Avi Feller. I graduated from UCLA in June 2021 with my B.S. in Statistics.\nMy research is motivated by causal inference problems in health policy and medicine. I am interested in developing methods to help scientists make robust and transparent causal claims. I am also interested in solving data-driven problems using causal inference, machine learning, and survival analysis.\nMost of my work is collaborative. I am grateful to be working alongside scientists and clinicians from Genentech, Kaiser Permanente, and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.\nI have spent many summers as a statistics intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory and most recently completed a biostatistics internship at Denali Therapeutics in summer 2023. I will join Genentech as a data science intern in summer 2025.\nFeel free to connect with me via email or LinkedIn.\n\n\n\n\nRecent News\n\nFebruary 2025: Our paper on sensitivity analysis for causal decompositions is published in Statistics in Medicine!\nJanuary 2025: Our paper on sensitivity analysis for causal decompositions received student paper awards for the 2025 International Conference on Health Policy Statistics and the 2025 Joint Statistical Meetings.\nDecember 2024: Our paper on analyzing multiple sclerosis progression with volumetric MRI is now available on arXiv."
