::: {#hero-heading}
I am a fifth and final year PhD Candidate in Statistics at UC Berkeley. I am advised by [Haiyan Huang](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/haiyan-huang), [Sam Pimentel](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/sam-pimentel), and [Avi Feller](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/avi-feller). I graduated from UCLA in 2021 with my B.S. in Statistics.

My research is motivated by causal inference problems in health policy and medicine. I am interested in developing methods to help scientists make robust and transparent causal claims. I am also interested in solving data-driven problems using causal inference, machine learning, and survival analysis. My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 

<!-- Most of my work is collaborative. I am grateful to be working alongside scientists and clinicians from Genentech, Kaiser Permanente, and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.  -->

<!-- I have spent many summers as a statistics intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory and most recently completed a biostatistics internship at Denali Therapeutics in summer 2023. **I will join Genentech as a data science intern in summer 2025.** -->

**I am seeking full-time roles starting in mid-2026.** Please feel free to connect with me via email or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shen-andy/).
