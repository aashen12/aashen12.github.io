::: {#hero-heading}
I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in Statistics at UC Berkeley. I am advised by [Haiyan Huang](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/haiyan-huang) and [Sam Pimentel](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/sam-pimentel). I graduated from UCLA in June 2021 with my B.S. in Statistics.

My research is motivated by applied problems in health policy and medicine. I am interested in developing causal inference methods to help scientists make robust and transparent causal claims. I am also interested in solving data-driven problems using statistical learning and causal inference tools.

Most of my work is collaborative. I am grateful to be working alongside scientists and clinicians from Genentech, Kaiser Permanente, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. My research is supported by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.

I have spent many summers as a statistics intern at Los Alamos National Laboratory and most recently completed a biostatistics internship at Denali Therapeutics in summer 2023.

Feel free to connect with me via email or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shen-andy/).
